This program is a web server with a configurable ip and port at start up. It
serves HTML, CSS, JS, and common image files via GET requests, sufficient to
be accessed by most browsers. The program must be provided with a root folder
containing an index.html, err404.html, and err505.html at minimum. The webserver
will not access files above the root folder, so all pages should be stored in it.

IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are both acceptable, and should one not be given, it
will default to an available IPv4 address (127.0.0.1, 127.0.1.1, etc.).

Ports are accepted in the standard range, and if one is not specified, the
server will automatically be assigned a random open port.

Verbose output additionally indicates how much data each client connection is
reading and sending in each event loop, and includes the file descriptor of the
client's socket for debugging.

The makefile provided will build the web server from web-server.c and 
web-server.h, and will name the program with the current OS and processor.
